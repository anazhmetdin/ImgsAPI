# ImgsAPI

Here is an example of using this API:

[![click to open the api](https://imgsapi-production.up.railway.app/api/images?width=400&height=400&filename=fjord)](https://imgsapi-production.up.railway.app/api/images?width=400&height=400&filename=fjord)

Click this image to visit the API link. I've hosted this app on [railway.app](https://railway.app) so that it would be accessible.

To build this app:

```bash
npm run build
```

To start this app:

```bash
npm run start
```

To visit the hosted app on your local device:

* Open the following link on the browser:
  * [localhost:3000/api/images](localhost:3000/api/images)

All images are inside the "images" folder and the cached images are stored inside the "thumbs"
